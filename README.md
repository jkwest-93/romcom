title: RomCom - Pair
---
## Project & Goals
### Project description
This project represents the collaborative efforts of Taryn Martin and Jake West. This is our first paired project in Mod 1 of the Turing Front End Program (Cohort 2005). We were tasked with building an app that generates romance novel covers, populated by a random cover image, title, and two subtitle descriptors. We were given a existing codebase for CSS styling elements & HTML elements to manipulate, as well as data arrays to reference & a constructor element to create objects. We were responsible for using JavaScript to build out further functionality. This project was broken into multiple iterations, each with unique requirements (described below). The functionality we successfully built includes:
  1. random cover generator
  2. button functionality to switch views
  3. TBD.....

### Learning Goals

* Deepen our understanding of JavaScript syntax & logic
* Learn how JavaScript interacts with CSS & HTML code, as well as DOM elements
* Minimize external research & rely on skills we've built
* Comprehension > production
* Strengthen our skills as collaborators on a project

## Project Status

Currently in development: working on using "Make Your Own Cover" form to create new covers with user input.

## Set Up

To begin, choose ONE PARTNER to do the following:

1. Fork this boilerplate repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. `cd` into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal
5. Add all project partners and your assigned instructor as collaborators on the repository

Then, as a team:

* Explore the repository to see what's going on in the code
  - Look at each file: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `data.js`, `Cover.js`, `main.js`
  - _Note: no imports or exports are needed because each JS file is linked in the HTML_
  - Even if you don't know what each piece of the code is doing, talk through what you think is going on
* What pieces of code might you use to complete iterations, and what pieces will you have to create?
* All of your work will take place in `main.js` - you will not need to change any other files!

## Day 1 Deliverables

By the end of the day, complete the following tasks:

* As a team, read the entire project spec and rubric
* As a team, create a rough timeline to follow
* As a team, create a public document for your DTR (instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/dtr_guidelines_memo.md))
* Make sure all teammates are added as collaborators to the forked repository
* Create a private Slack channel with all members of the project AND your assigned instructor and share links to:
  - the forked GitHub repo
  - the GitHub Pages deployed site
    - Under your repo's settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages and set it up to deploy your master branch
  - the DTR

## Progression

For a description of iterations, visit [the project page](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/romcom-paired.html) on the curriculum site.

## Rubric

This rubric should serve as a guide for students as they progress through the project, as well as to self-evaluate. Instructors will use it to evaluate the project at its final due date/time, and provide detailed feedback so students know what areas to focus on in future projects.

Scores land in a range between 1 and 4. Below is a breakdown of what those numbers represent.

* **4 (exceptional)** - went beyond set learning goals; did self-teaching to go above and beyond in this area
* **3 (proficient)** - exactly on track! you're where you need to be in this area! great work!
* **2 (trailing)** - a little behind where we want to see you right now; in a good place to build familiarity/competency in this area; study in this area to level up and grow
* **1 (dragging)** - significantly behind where we want to see you; major growth needs to be shown in this area; set up a pairing session with an instructor as soon as possible

To earn a given score, an application must meet the requirements listed in that score explanation and all scores lower.

### Professionalism

* **4:**
  - Team uses a PR template
  - Team habitually conducts thorough code reviews in the GitHub GUI to document the progress of the application
  - Team has sought out code reviews from one or more mentors
  - README is well formatted and descriptive with screenshots or gifs of the application in action
* **3:**
  - Commits are atomic and frequent, effectively documenting the evolution/progression of the application
  - Commit messages are consistent, descriptive, and concise
  - Team uses PRs to screen/verify code before adding it to the master branch
  - There is no more than a 10% disparity in code contributions between teammates
  - README is well formatted and gives good context about the project, including links to both contributors' GitHub profiles, and to the deployed GitHub Pages site
* **2:**
  - Commits are large and do not effectively communicate the progression of the application
  - Team uses PRs but do not review code before merging into the master branch
  - All teammates can speak to the purpose and functionality of any/every line of code
  - There is a 20% disparity in code contributions between teammates
  - README is brief and does not provide context for the project
* **1:**
  - Teammates do not understand the purpose and functionality of every line of code
  - Some commits are pushed directly to the master branch
  - PRs are used inconsistently
  - There is a 50% disparity in code contributions between teammates
  - There is no README, or README is insufficient

### JavaScript Style & Implementation

* **4:**
  - There are no global variables aside from query selectors, `currentCover` and `savedCovers`.
  - All functions strictly adhere to [SRP](http://knnthvu.weebly.com/srp-and-dry.html) and - with few exceptions - are around 10 lines of code or less
  - All functions and variables are semantically and concisely named
  - Uses logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable
  - Code contains no antipatterns
* **3:**
  - Application uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements
  - Functions are [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and observe [SRP](http://knnthvu.weebly.com/srp-and-dry.html)
  - Functions make use of parameters and arguments in order to be more dynamic
* **2:**
  - Properly uses parameters and arguments when used
  - Uses named functions instead of anonymous functions as event handlers in event listeners
  - Correctly uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic & error handling
* **1:**
  - Crafts JS according to the [Turing JS style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)


### Functional Expectations

Functionality is the least important piece of the rubric. It's included because it is another benchmark to gauge proficiency. However, you should not pursue functionality at the expense of code quality or the learning/growth of all team members.

This means, we DO NOT want to see:
- Code that completes iterations but is sloppy
- One or both team members do not understand every single line of code
- One or both team members skips the problem solving process (pseudocoding, talking out the problem, articulating, planning) in the pursuit of completing functionality

* **4:** Applications completes one or more of the extensions without bugs
* **3:** Application completes all the expectations of Iteration 4 without bugs
* **2:** Application completes all the expectations of Iteration 3 without bugs
* **1:** Application completes all the expectations of Iteration 2 without bugs
